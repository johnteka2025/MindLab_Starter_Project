TODAY’S LESSONS-LEARNED SUMMARY (2025-12-08)

1. Duplicate files caused repeated errors:
   - React imported the wrong components.
   - Fix: remove/move duplicates before debugging.

2. Wrong imports broke routing and Vite:
   - One incorrect import can stop the whole UI.
   - Fix imports FIRST.

3. Daily UI tests failed because the wrong page loaded:
   - The app was showing Home instead of Daily.
   - Fix routing, test manually in browser.

4. JSON errors 'Unexpected token <' mean the frontend
   is talking to Vite instead of backend.
   - Fix API URLs, confirm backend is running on port 8085.

5. Editing the wrong file wastes time:
   - Vite error overlays show the real file path.
   - Always check the path before editing.

6. After cleaning duplicates + fixing imports:
   - Frontend loaded correctly.
   - /app/daily worked.
   - All Playwright tests PASSED.
   - run_ui_suite.ps1 PASSED.

Future reminder:
   - Check duplicates
   - Check real file paths
   - Verify routing manually
   - Test backend endpoints directly
   - THEN run Playwright
