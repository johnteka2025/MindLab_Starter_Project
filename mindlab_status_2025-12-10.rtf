MindLab – Daily Status (2025-12-10)

1. Local full-check
   - Script: frontend\run_all.ps1
   - Result: Sanity script PASS, Playwright e2e PASS (6 tests).

2. Safety backup
   - Script: frontend\backup_fullcheck.ps1
   - Latest backup folder: frontend\backups\fullcheck_20251210_1949
   - Contents:
     * Helper scripts (run_all.ps1, etc.).
     * All key Playwright specs:
       - daily-challenge.spec.ts, daily-challenge-prod.spec.ts
       - mindlab-basic.spec.ts, health-and-puzzles.spec.ts
       - mindlab-daily-ui.spec.ts, mindlab-daily-ui-optional.spec.ts
       - mindlab-daily-solve.spec.ts, mindlab-daily-result.spec.ts
       - progress-ui.spec.ts, progress-api.spec.ts, progress-api-prod.spec.ts
       - puzzles-navigation.spec.ts
   - Status: Backup completed successfully.

3. Environment
   - Backend: http://localhost:8085 (health, puzzles, progress, daily = 200).
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5177/app and /app/daily responding as expected.

4. Notes
   - Full local sanity + UI stack is stable.
   - Full-check backup can be repeated via run_fullcheck_backup.ps1 at root.

5. Next steps (high level)
   - Use run_all.ps1 + backup_fullcheck.ps1 as regular “full stack + backup”.
   - Start building a simple “start-of-day” script that spins up backend + frontend then runs quick sanity.
