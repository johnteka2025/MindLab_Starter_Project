\b MindLab Daily Status - 2025-11-30\b0\par
\par
Completed today:\par
\par
- Daily MindLab routine (backend + frontend health + route sanity) is stable.\par
- Daily UI Playwright test (\i mindlab-daily-ui.spec.ts\i0) is green in both headed and headless mode.\par
- Frontend /app and /app/daily both load correctly via Vite dev on port 5177.\par
- Helper scripts for daily stack and UI test are in place and working.\par
\par
Next phases / actions:\par
\par
Phase 1 (Stability & UX):\par
- Add clearer success / failure feedback on the Daily Challenge page after submitting an answer.\par
- Extend Playwright coverage for the /app/daily flow (success, error, edge cases).\par
\par
Phase 2 (Game design):\par
- Finalize XP, Level, and Streak rules so the /progress endpoint becomes more meaningful.\par
- Design how daily puzzles contribute to long-term progression.\par
\par
Phase 3 (Polish / cleanup):\par
- Clean up any old helper scripts we no longer need and keep only the "daily routine" path plus a small set of dev helpers.\par
- Review logs and tighten error messages for easier troubleshooting.\par
