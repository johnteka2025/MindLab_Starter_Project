\par
Next phases / actions:\par
\par
Phase 1 (Stability & UX):\par
- Add clearer success / error feedback on the Daily Challenge page after submitting an answer.\par
- Extend Playwright coverage on the /app/daily flow (submit demo answer, verify messages).\par
\par
Phase 2 (Game design rules):\par
- Finalize XP, Level, and Streak rules so the /progress endpoint and UI become more meaningful.\par
- Define how daily puzzles contribute to long-term progression in MindLab.\par
\par
Phase 3 (Polish / cleanup):\par
- Clean up any old helper scripts and keep only the “daily routine” + “daily start” + a small set of dev helpers.\par
- Review logs and tighten error messages to make troubleshooting easier.\par
